# Sliding Messaging Pro

This was the very first app that @klinker41 and I released together. We were freshmen in college, and it shows in the code... But we made something unique and fun. It was successful and brought us to where we are today :)

There isn't really any work being put into this app any longer. It has been unpublished from the Play Store, but it still works, and works pretty well!

This app was originally released at the end of 2012. It has aged, and is stuck in the holo days, but it would only take the right touch to bring it up to date with material design.

### Building the app

Just use gradle. The project can be opened in Android Studio and it will build as is.

All the dependencies are up to date, at the time of open-sourcing this project. I will periodically go through and continue to keep them up to date.

### What can you use it for?

Basically anything. There are cool things in here, some advanced `ViewPager` stuff with memory and keeping things up to date. Lots of different features and settings, some cool, some quirky. Overall, the app still works pretty well. It was one of the first of it's kind: ultimate customization and a focus on design.

Some neat things:
- Theme engine (might get around to open sourcing that seperate theme engine app too)
- Swipe between conversations
- SMS/MMS support and examples of working with the `ContentProvider`
- Tons of settings
- SlideOver (a lot like Facebook's chatheads)

If you want to bring it up to the material design era and want to release a material design version, I won't stop you, but it would be some work to integrate `AppCompat`.

## Future of the App

I probably won't do any work on this app again. Obviously pull requests are welcome, but as for issues, I doubt that I will have time to fix them.

I am putting this out here just to show how far we have come. It isn't all good, but it is a very neat project. Remember the good-old days of Android development when I wasn't bogged down with replying to emails and could actually work :)

Anyways, enjoy the app, if you ever do anything with it, let me know, would love to see if anything comes from this project!
