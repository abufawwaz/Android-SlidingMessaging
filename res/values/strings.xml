    <string name="tip_speed_title">Dev. Tip #1 (Speed and Sluggishness):</string>
    <string name="tip_speed">
        With the latest update, we have made a few great strides toward a completely lag free app. But obviously this is a difficult task
        because of the style and what we are trying to do with the app. It is very memory intensive and uses a lot of resources to load so many messages at once.
        Many more than any other messaging app has to do. That is why it can be a little more sluggish than most if you have a ton of messages.\n\n

        As for my speed tip, you have 2 options really. Both are compromises, but that is what you are gonna have to deal with in an app like this:\n\n

        1.) DELETE MESSAGES! This is what we have been preaching since the beginning. IT WILL HELP YOU :) this is my first suggestion.\n\n

        I understand that some people may not want to do this though, because they like to keep them for their records. There are backup solutions out there for this purpose. Use them.
        Deleting messages makes a huge difference if you have a ton of them. For reference, the app works flawlessly, zero lag, on my nexus 4 with around 2000 messages that I have now.
        I can\'t test more than that right now obviously, but if you are someone that keeps 10000 on your phone or some ungodly amount like this, obviously this is going to have a
        severely negative effect with our app.\n\n

        Like i said, this is my first suggestion to everyone.\n\n

        2.) Check the \"override for performance\" option under advanced settings and set your theme to cards 2.0.\n\n

        This is more of a workaround, but it is, from my experience, a set of default settings that are the most optimized and work the best on any phone.
        It does take away some of the customization. But your themes and stuff, for the most part, will work. I just took out some of the extra, unnecessary things.
        This option is a compromise. If you aren\'t willing to clear out your inbox, try it out. It will work better, I know this for a fact, but it will also take
        away some of your settings, know that.\n\n

        3.) Turn off the action bar contact info options!\n\n

        I know they feel like they should be quick and easy, but they are not, at all. Google must take a heck of a lot of resources to get this stuff to change, because it is quite a
        dramatic slowdown when you use them. These options can be found under Theme Settings then Title Bar settings. They are the bottom two in that category. Turn them off and feel the power.\n\n

        I honestly don\'t want to hear about lag or stuttering that much any more. We have given you the tools to fix it. If you choose not to use them, then so be it.
        But they are there and that is how this is gonna work :)
    </string>
    <string name="tip_incoming_mms_title">Dev. Tip #2 (Incoming MMS):</string>
    <string name="tip_incoming_mms">
        This tip is definitely more of a workaround, but I am tired of people telling us that they can\'t get MMS to download.
        Sending is a whole \'nother issue, but downloading will work on every phone, every time, if you know how to set it up.\n\n

        I have emailed this out so many times that I think it is just time to put it in here for everyone to see.\n\n

        So here is how you should set up downloading MMS messages:\n\n

        1.) check the receive through stock option.\n\n

        This option makes it so that it doesn\'t matter what other settings you have, your message will use the stock apps services to download.
        It doesn\'t matter if you have override stock checked or not. This lets the stock app handle all downloads so you don\'t have to worry about APN\'s
        or a WiFi fix that so many people hate us for.\n\n

        2.) In the stock messaging app, check the auto download option.\n\n

        This is just what it sounds, it will automatically download your messages for you when the carrier receives them. It isn\'t slower than having to push
        the download button, and there really are no downsides to this.\n\n

        3.) Un-check the auto-download button in Sliding Messaging\n\n

        This will make sure that you aren\'t getting double notifications.\n\n

        So there you go, this is really the best way to handle downloading MMS and it will work flawlessly every time, just like the stock one should.
        It will still throw the Sliding Messaging notification as well, so no problems there.\n\n

        EVERYTHING WILL WORK HOW IT SHOULD, EVERY TIME\n\n

        So now we will have no more problems with downloading MMS! :)

    <string name="tip_slideover_title">Dev. Tip #3 (SlideOver Features)</string>
    <string name="tip_slideover">
        Settings Overview (be aware some of these are only accessible by checking the \"Show All Settings\" option in advanced settings):\n\n

        1) Horizontal Positioning determines whether the bubble is on the right or left of the screen\n
        2) Vertical Positioning sets how far from the top of the screen the bubble is\n
        3) Sliver Widths changes the amount of bubble you see, lower the sliver width, the less you will see on the edge of the screen\n
        4) Activation Width is the percent of the screen that the arc covers to activate the popup\n
        5) Arc Break Point will adjust the length of the dashed line on the bottom half of the arc\n
        6) Secondary action lets you select what happens when you are in the dashed area, either opening to the conversation list or creating a new message\n
        7) Enable haptic feedback, that one is self explanatory. vibrate on or off\n
        8) Auto-close SlideOver will close it when you have replied to a new message, very convenient for exiting quickly and getting back to what you were doing\n
        9) SlideOver Side changes the padding on the top and bottom of the popup window, making it smaller or much larger. Be careful of setting values to small though, then it wont show at all\n\n\n


        Now, as for the main features of SlideOver:\n\n

        1) There is the new popup which everyone can take advantage of to see an entire conversation when a new message comes in, MMS support for that conversation, etc. Lots better than the old popups\n
        2) The bubble allows you a \"chatheads\", yet extremely minimal interface, which you can allows use to pull up the app from anywhere at any time,
        whether or not you have new messages or just want to compose a new one\n
        3) When you do have new messages, you can quickly see a preview of each message and depending on how far you slide your finger from the bubble, it will
        highlight a different conversation which will then allow you to quickly access that conversation. That way, you can allows quickly tell how many new
        messages you have and decide which you actually want to respond to first, or at all\n
        4) There are 3 buttons at the top of the window when SlideOver has been activated and the arc is shown on screen to easily allow you to clear all of the notifications,
        close slideover all together and get the bubble out of the way, or go to settings to move it around or whatever you want to do with it

    <string name="tip_contacts_title">Dev. Tip #4 (Contact Syncing)</string>
    <string name="tip_contacts">
        I get a lot of questions as to \"why I can\'t see my contact pictures\" or \"some of my contacts don\'t show up in the app?!\"\n\n

        There is good reason for this, it is because we only pull pictures and contacts from your google account. The reason behind this is 1) it is easier for us, and 2) it is
        quicker because we only have one place to look for pictures, decreasing loading times.\n\nAs for the solution, there are many
        apps out there that will accomplish this task for you quickly and easily. I recommend:\n\n

        1.) Haxsync\n\n

        2.) Contact Picture Sync\n\n

        3.) Ubersync\n\n

        All these programs work well and will get you the contact pictures that you want so dearly :)</string>

        Any users who is on Android 4.3 can now do this by going into their system settings, security, and clicking the \"Notification Access\" option (or simply by clicking on this tip).\n\n

        You will then be taken to a list of all apps which have added this ability and simply enable Sliding Messaging with the check box. From now on, whenever you swipe away the notification it will mark your message
        as read, eliminating the need for the \"Read\" button on the notification!

       NOTE: This is currently experimental as it seems enabling the notification listener (from the link obtained by tapping this setting) can cause the app to misread some incoming SMS and not throw the notification when they arrive if Sliding Messaging has been cleared from the recent apps menu.\n\n

       We are aware of the problem and are looking into it. If you are missing notifications, disable the notification listener for now and use a different method to receive Google Voice messages.</string>

                                                 2) The accessibility service cannot cancel Google Voice notifications (this is a limitation of the Android system), but if you turn them off through the Voice app then Sliding Messaging won\'t
                                                 receive the messages at all. If you are using OPTION ONE, you must have notifications enabled for Google Voice, meaning Jellybean (4.1 and 4.2) and ICS (4.0) users will get double notifications\n\n</string>
