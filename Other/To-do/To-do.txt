- Android wear stuff from evolve

Jake:
    - delayed sending for certain times
Luke:
    - Forward mms with multiple attachments
    - Mark as read when multiple messages come in
    - Add location support
    - Collogue of people's icons on group thread
    - Smoother animations
    - New refresh system... maybe
    - Force close on attach more
    - Notification sounds with slideover and popup


Bugs:
    - jumps to the middle of a conversation sometimes after sending a reply
    - Text in the action bar isn't always right when you open from a notification

1) more individual notification options (notification icon)
2) option for adding certain text to every message at the beginning (delivery reports?)
3) Tasker options
4) Pin contact to always be first conversation
5) Auto call when phone is placed to the ear (proximity sensor)
6) Add a crouton notification for drafts instead of current system, then use a pull to refresh on the bottom to fill the text box with the draft. again, don't know if this would work well or is possible to attach another one to the list view, but it might be cool
7) Add scheduled sms to bottom of conversation in a footer maybe
8) Add sent or received icon to conversations list
