Version 6.60
- Sent message sounds
- Investigate MMS apns on stock
- Message Locking?
- Make MMS settings page in changelog wizard to easily select carrier
- make mms in message array adapter and change classic ui to use the same adapter
- sms backup
	- different icon in notification
	- apply for mms
	- redo cursors for more efficiency
	- make sure menu page works as expected (closes alarm manager on uncheck, makes SD or Drive is checked when you run it)
	- implement store to drive (comment out the choices until that is done)
	- actually delete the messages :) just uncomment the code. it should work just fine
	- add notifications to delete and drive backup
- fix popup residual message in some cases
- fix MMS pictures not opening correctly in he gallery app, even though it shows in the message list

Likes ideas for speed/fluidity improvement:
1.) Limit conversations to 10 and add back the load all messages button
		- would not be able to limit query, but could just not display all of them by changing the
		  getCount methods of the menu array adapter and pager adapter
2.) Limit initial messages loaded to 10 or 12
		- Would do almost nothing
3.) Don't refresh the view pager when a new message is received that isn't from the conversation you are currently viewing. Make a refresh attached in the cconversations list to refresh the view pager instead, so it doesnt jump around and the users can continue texting without being interrupted. It will look better and work more fluidly.
		- not sure how this would affect scrolling through the view pager though. may work, but may never move the threads to the correct position

0) more individual notification options
3) Batch delete of messages inside single conversation
5) Tasker options
6) Attach more options for MMS - create slideshow with videos and audio and pictures, attach plain text contact info
9) search through messages
10) Pin contact to always be first conversation
