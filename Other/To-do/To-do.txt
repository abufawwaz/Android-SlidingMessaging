Version 7.60

Jake:
    - active notifications contact picture
    - look into downloading mms and data getting stuck
    - Attach subject to options menu and then add edit text at top of conversation and under new contact entry area
    - Attach audio and video to mms
    - delayed sending for certain times
    - rewrite menu array adapter as cursor adaptor
    - actionbar pull to refresh, get the newest changes
Luke:
    - Message details for MMS messages
    - Fix image inserting button on slideover
    - Find out why it fills the screen when attaching from camera

1) more individual notification options (slideover color, notification icon)
2) option for adding certain text to every message at the beginning (delivery reports?)
3) Tasker options
4) Attach more options for MMS - create slideshow with videos and audio and pictures, attach plain text contact info
5) Pin contact to always be first conversation
6) Auto call when phone is placed to the ear (proximity sensor)
7) Add a crouton notification for drafts instead of current system, then use a pull to refresh on the bottom to fill the text box with the draft. again, don't know if this would work well or is possible to attach another one to the list view, but it might be cool
8) Add scheduled sms to bottom of conversation in a footer maybe
9) Add sent or received icon to conversations list

- sms backup
	- different icon in notification
	- apply for mms
	- redo cursors for more efficiency
	- make sure menu page works as expected (closes alarm manager on uncheck, makes SD or Drive is checked when you run it)
	- implement store to drive (comment out the choices until that is done
	- add notifications to drive backup
	- cancel scheduled button
	- Dated folders for backups
	- check to make sure backup exists before deleting

Luke's ideas for speed/fluidity improvement:
3.) Don't refresh the view pager when a new message is received that isn't from the conversation you are currently viewing. Make a refresh attached in the conversations list to refresh the view pager instead, so it doesnt jump around and the users can continue texting without being interrupted. It will look better and work more fluidly.
        - not sure how this would affect scrolling through the view pager though. may work, but may never move the threads to the correct position

Make an NFC bikelock hehe
