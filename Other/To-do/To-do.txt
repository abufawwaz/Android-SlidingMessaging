Version 7.25

Jake:
    - recreate settings activity after restoring previous backup
    - make resending in cursor adapter use new library
    - google voice sending support
    - google voice receiving support
    - Figure out how to judge file size of png images and adjust them accordingly when sending, look into UriImage.getResizedImageData for solution
    - delayed sending for certain times
Luke:

1) more individual notification options
2) option for adding certain text to every message at the beginning (delivery reports?)
3) Tasker options
4) Attach more options for MMS - create slideshow with videos and audio and pictures, attach plain text contact info
5) Pin contact to always be first conversation
6) Auto call when phone is placed to the ear (proximity sensor)

- sms backup
	- different icon in notification
	- apply for mms
	- redo cursors for more efficiency
	- make sure menu page works as expected (closes alarm manager on uncheck, makes SD or Drive is checked when you run it)
	- implement store to drive (comment out the choices until that is done
	- add notifications to drive backup
	- cancel scheduled button
	- Dated folders for backups
	- check to make sure backup exists before deleting

Luke's ideas for speed/fluidity improvement:
3.) Don't refresh the view pager when a new message is received that isn't from the conversation you are currently viewing. Make a refresh attached in the conversations list to refresh the view pager instead, so it doesnt jump around and the users can continue texting without being interrupted. It will look better and work more fluidly.
        - not sure how this would affect scrolling through the view pager though. may work, but may never move the threads to the correct position
