Version 6.70

- floating notifications extension
- make hangouts bubbles staggered in conversation list, like the actual hangouts app instead of even on both sides
- port cards UI 2.0 to search activity
- Fix a few things with full app popup
- option for adding certain text to every message at the beginning (delivery reports?)
- Message Locking
- fix popup residual message in some cases
- Figure out how to judge file size of png images and adjust them accordingly when sending, look into UriImage.getResizedImageData for solution
- compare loading 15 messages on startup instead of 20
- look into scheduled SMS bug reported
- Update theme editor description

Luke's ideas for speed/fluidity improvement:
3.) Don't refresh the view pager when a new message is received that isn't from the conversation you are currently viewing. Make a refresh attached in the conversations list to refresh the view pager instead, so it doesnt jump around and the users can continue texting without being interrupted. It will look better and work more fluidly.
		- not sure how this would affect scrolling through the view pager though. may work, but may never move the threads to the correct position

0) more individual notification options
3) Batch delete of messages inside single conversation
5) Tasker options
6) Attach more options for MMS - create slideshow with videos and audio and pictures, attach plain text contact info
10) Pin contact to always be first conversation

- sms backup
	- different icon in notification
	- apply for mms
	- redo cursors for more efficiency
	- make sure menu page works as expected (closes alarm manager on uncheck, makes SD or Drive is checked when you run it)
	- implement store to drive (comment out the choices until that is done
	- add notifications to drive backup
	- cancel scheduled button
	- Dated folders for backups
	- check to make sure backup exists before deleting
	
- Halo Popup app
	- Simple app like the HALO)))
	- Allows users to select which apps they would like to launch in halo automatically on new notification
	- Makes a popup available for any app... Messaging, Hangouts, Facebook, Flacon, really whatever app you want to launch automatically on a notification
	- Open Source and free on the play store
	- Apply new Notification Listener APIs (only for Android 4.3 and above, would also get rid of people downloading and rating it low because they don't know what it does...)
	- Should be simple enough to make, I've already done it all in Sliding Messaging, and sounds like a pretty applicable app to me.
