Side Project: Emoji Keyboard
    - Look and feel just like hangouts emoji keyboard does with 5 catagories, recents and sliding between pages
    - usable in any app to insert emojis (although not all emojis would show in every app unless support was specifically added in that app or android font)
    - contact other devs (maybe falcon pro) and talk about supporting in their apps. Would gain visibility for app and also add support for features users have been asking for in falcon
    - charged at $0.99 or $1.99 and advertise in Sliding Messaging for it
    - github library with EmojiConverter class and images so other apps can easily adapt and use all 855 icons
