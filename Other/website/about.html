		<p>MMS success will depend on your APN settings from your carrier currently, confirmed working on GSM carriers in the US, and should work on most carriers.</p>
		<p>For startup speed issues, be sure to check the option in advanced settings for "run as background service".</p>
		<p>If you are having problems receiving notifications, you may need to uninstall 3rd party messengers such as Go SMS.</p>
		<p>When using this app, do not disable the stock messaging app as I use it to permanently save messages to the phone. You can however, disable notifications for it so that you don't receive 2 of them.</p>
		<p>Please remember the app is still in beta and evolving every day. Let me know if something is missing or not working how you feel it should and I will do my best to correct it!</p>
