For next update (6.20):
    - message summary when you click on the message like stock app does
    - popup theme support for theme manager
        - message background
        - send bar background
        - divider color
        - name text color
        - date text color

        - button text color
        - draft text color
        - emoji button color
    - cursor loader in messaging_donate.MainActivity instead of in separate main activities
        - allows for ability of a "loading screen" instead of just black, use progress bar
        - cursor loader may load cursors faster then manually loading them in a single thread as android would handle everything internally and more efficiently hopefully
    - contact lister to scroll through all contacts and decide who to send message to that way

0) more individual notification options
1) Draft system
2) Scheduled SMS
3) Security options for locking app
4) Black widget option, no background widget option

Side Project: Emoji Keyboard
    - Look and feel just like hangouts emoji keyboard does with 5 catagories, recents and sliding between pages
    - usable in any app to insert emojis (although not all emojis would show in every app unless support was specifically added in that app or android font)
    - contact other devs (maybe falcon pro) and talk about supporting in their apps. Would gain visibility for app and also add support for features users have been asking for in falcon
    - charged at $0.99 or $1.99 and advertise in Sliding Messaging for it
    - github library with EmojiConverter class and images so other apps can easily adapt and use all 855 icons
